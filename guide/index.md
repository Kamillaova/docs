# Quick start

This is a quick guide on how to get mtcute up and running as fast as possible.

## NodeJS

For bots in NodeJS, there's a special package that scaffolds a project for you:

```bash
pnpm create @mtcute/bot my-awesome-bot
```

Just follow the instructions and you'll get a working bot in no time!

### Manually

For existing projects, you'll probably want to add it manually, though.

> **Note**: mtcute is currently targeting TypeScript 5.0. 
> If you are using an older version of TypeScript, please consider upgrading.

1. Get your API ID and Hash at
   [https://my.telegram.org/apps](https://my.telegram.org/apps).
2. Install `@mtcute/node` meta-package:

```bash
pnpm add @mtcute/node
```

3. Import the package and create a client:

```ts
import { NodeTelegramClient } from '@mtcute/node'

const tg = new NodeTelegramClient({
    apiId: API_ID,
    apiHash: 'API_HASH'
})

tg.run({ ... }, async (self) => {
    console.log(`Logged in as ${self.displayName}`)

    await tg.sendText('self', 'Hello from <b>MTCute</b>!')
})
```
4. That's literally it! Happy hacking ðŸš€

### Native crypto addon
mtcute also provides `@mtcute/crypto-node` package, that implements
a native NodeJS addon for crypto functions used in MTProto.

Using this addon improves overall library performance (especially when uploading/downloading files), 
so it is advised that you install it as well:

```bash
pnpm add @mtcute/crypto-node
```

When using `@mtcute/node`, native addon is loaded automatically,
no extra steps are required. Otherwise, you'll need to enable it manually:

```ts{4}
import { NodeNativeCryptoProvider } from '@mtcute/crypto-node'

const tg = new TelegramClient({
    crypto: () => new NodeNativeCryptoProvider(),
    ...
})
```

## Browser

For browsers, it is recommended to use [vite](https://vitejs.dev). 
Webpack is probably also fine, but you may need to do some extra configuration.

Usage in browsers is a less common use case, so there's no scaffolding tool for it yet.
You can still add the library manually, though:

```bash
pnpm add @mtcute/client
```

> For vite, you'll also need to deoptimize `@mtcute/wasm` (see [vite#8427](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/8427)):
> ```ts
> // in vite.config.ts
> export default defineConfig({
>   optimizeDeps: {
>     exclude: ['@mtcute/wasm']
>   }
> })
> ```

and then use it as you wish:

```ts
import { TelegramClient } from '@mtcute/client'

const tg = new TelegramClient({
    apiId: 123456,
    apiHash: '0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef',
})

tg.call({ _: 'help.getConfig' }).then((res) => console.log(res))
```

## Other runtimes

### Bun/Deno
These runtimes are not actively supported and tested, but mtcute *seems* to work fine with them.

For Deno, however, you'll have to manually use the web crypto provider, since the Node
compatibility layer is not good enough yet:

```ts
import { TelegramClient } from 'npm:@mtcute/client'
import { WebCryptoProvider } from 'npm:@mtcute/core/utils/crypto/web.js'

const tg = new TelegramClient({
  crypto: () => new WebCryptoProvider({ crypto: window.crypto }),
  // ...
})
```
Other than that, you can likely use it the same way as in NodeJS. 

If you find any issues when running in Bun/Deno, please first check if they are 
reproducible in Node. Feel free to open an issue in both cases, but please note that
issues with alternative runtimes interop are not a priority.

### Anything else?

mtcute supports both ESM and CJS, so it should work in any environment that supports either of them,
as long as it also supports these featues:
  - `ArrayBuffer`, `Uint8Array`, `TextEncoder/TextDecoder` - for binary data
  - `ReadableStream` - for uploading/downloading files
  - `SubtleCrypto`, `WebAssembly` - for crypto functions (optional if using custom crypto)

Of course, nothing is stopping you from bundling the library with Webpack or Rollup and using some polyfills.

You'll also likely have to implement custom storage, networking and crypto, 
see [Storage](/guide/topics/storage.md) and [Transport](/guide/topics/transport.md) for more info.

If you manage to get mtcute working in some exotic environment, please let me know!
